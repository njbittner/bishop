* Guide to these exercises:
  1) run 'python value_iteration.py' to see an example of the determinsitic value-iteration that we talked about in today's meeting. Credit: [[https://github.com/rlcode/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/1-grid-world][this repo]]
  2) if you installed OpenAI's gym package, then you can also run 'python exercises.py' to see an example of a random agent playing cartpole.
  3) Finally, check out [[https://github.com/ShangtongZhang/reinforcement-learning-an-introduction][this repo]] to find code for all of S&B, like the tic-tac-toe example from ch 1.
